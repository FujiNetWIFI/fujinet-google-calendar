/*
 * Video probe, attribute tables, and the blitter.
 *
 * The screen is whatever the machine was showing when GCAL was typed: mode
 * 0 or 1 is 40x25, mode 2 or 3 is 80x25, mode 7 is the MDA. The probe reads
 * the current mode from the BIOS, remembers it for plat_shutdown(), and only
 * changes it when asked to (/40, /80) or forced to (a graphics mode, or
 * EGA/VGA talked into 43/50 rows -- both go back to mode 3 rather than
 * teaching the views a geometry nothing else has).
 *
 * Cells are written straight into the text page at B800:0000 -- B000:0000
 * for the MDA -- rather than through the BIOS. INT 10h writes one cell per
 * two interrupts (position, then write); a full 80x25 repaint is 4,000 of
 * them, which is visible on a 4.77 MHz 8088, and this program repaints whole
 * screens on every view switch. The one machine direct writes upset is the
 * genuine IBM CGA, which snows in 80-column text; /SNOW gates every write on
 * the retrace for that card. A switch rather than a heuristic because there
 * is no reliable way to detect a true CGA, snow is cosmetic, and the PCjr,
 * the MDA and virtually every clone would otherwise pay the wait for a fault
 * they do not have -- which is also how the software of the era shipped it.
 *
 * Command tail: /40 and /80 pick a width (and force the mode change), /MONO
 * keeps the black-and-white attribute table on a colour adapter -- for the
 * LCD and composite screens that render colour as mud -- and /SNOW is the
 * CGA gate above. Parsed from the PSP because the portable main() takes no
 * arguments.
