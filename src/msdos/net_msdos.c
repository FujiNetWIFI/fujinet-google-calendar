/*
 * fujinet-lib overrides for the network path. Defining the symbols here
 * leaves the library's members unreferenced, the src/adam/ pattern; each
 * carries the reason it exists and all of them should be deleted when
 * fujinet-lib catches up with the bus.
 *
 * The big one is the field descriptor. The current FUJINET.SYS speaks the
 * FujiBusPacket protocol, in which DH describes how the aux bytes become
 * typed parameters -- from the driver's and firmware's own tables,
 *
 *      DH:      0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7
 *      params:  0  1  2  3  4  1  2  1     (numFieldsTable)
 *      size:    -  u8 u8 u8 u8 u16 u16 u32 (fieldSizeTable)
 *
 * -- and fujinet-lib 4.11.2's int_f5_read/int_f5_write always send DH=0: no
 * parameters at all. Commands that need none (status, close, the fuji and
 * clock devices this client uses) work by luck; the two that carry them do
 * not. An open arrives as "Insufficient open paramaters: 0" in the firmware
 * log and a NAK on the wire, which is how the gmail client's first live run
 * against fujinet-pc-rs232 found it. So the two parameter-carrying calls
 * this client makes get their own bus entry with DH set properly:
 *
 * network_open(): needs DH=2 -- mode and trans as two u8 params -- plus the
 * devicespec as the write payload. The library's version also returned
 * network_error() from its failure path, and *that* returned
 * network_status()'s own return instead of the error byte it carried -- so
 * a refused open reported success and the 212 authorize-in-the-Web-UI
 * error, the one a first-time user is guaranteed to hit, could never name
 * itself. The payload is sent at its real length rather than the library's
 * flat 256: the firmware takes it into a std::string verbatim, and 200
 * bytes of stack garbage after the NUL would become part of the URL.
 *
 * network_read(): needs DH=5 -- the length as one u16 param, aux1 low. The
 * library's common network_read() under __WATCOMC__ additionally passes the
 * unit *number* where the msdos read expects a devicespec *pointer*, and
 * between chunks insists the status error byte be exactly 1 -- zero-as-
 * healthy being precisely the SIO quirk st_ok() in ../net.c exists for.
 * Replaced with one exact-length 'R': net.c never asks for more than status
 * said is staged and probes between chunks itself.
 *
 * network_write(): the third parameter-carrying call, added for the compose
 * form's draft channel. Same DH=5 shape as the read -- the firmware side
 * dispatches the write off one u16 length parameter -- with the payload
 * going out in the packet body and command 'W'.
 *
 * network_error(): returns the device's code, never 0 for a failed call.
