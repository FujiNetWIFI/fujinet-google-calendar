/*
 * Field sanitizer.
 *
 * Everything arriving from the wire passes through here on its way to a
 * display buffer. Two jobs:
 *
 *   - Control bytes (< 32) become spaces. This matters beyond looks: the
 *     Atari's conio treats $9B, $0A and $0D as newlines, so an unsanitized
 *     subject line could scroll the screen out from under us.
 *
 *   - Each *run* of bytes above plain ASCII collapses to a single '?'. The
 *     adapter does no charset conversion, so a UTF-8 name arrives as a
 *     multi-byte sequence; collapsing the run keeps "Jose" from turning into
 *     "Jos??" and keeps column budgets honest.
