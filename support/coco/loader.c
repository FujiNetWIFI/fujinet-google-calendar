/*
 * The model picker for the combined disk.

 * LOADM"GCAL":EXEC lands here rather than in the client, and this hands off to
 * GCAL1 on a CoCo 1/2 or GCAL3 on a CoCo 3. It is the whole reason one disk
 * can carry both binaries without asking the user which machine they are on.
 *
 * runm() is fujinet-fujirkle's: poke BASIC's direct-mode buffer with M"<name>",
 * point $A6 at it and enter the ROM's RUNM at $AE75. There is no LOADM callable
 * from C, and RUNM is what leaves the loader's own memory free for the client
 * that replaces it.
