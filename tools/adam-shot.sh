# Headless screen capture for the Adam build.
#
# ADAMEm is an SDL program with no monitor and no GDB stub, so this cannot work
# the way tools/coco-shot.sh does -- there is nothing to set a breakpoint in.
# What it has instead is a snapshot format that carries all 16K of VRAM, and an
# -autosnap mode that writes one at shutdown. So the recipe is: run the machine
# blind for a fixed wall-clock time with SDL's dummy drivers, stop it, and
# decode the screen out of the state it left behind.
#
# That means the capture is timing-based rather than event-based, which is the
# one respect in which this harness is weaker than the other three. WAIT is
# generous by default for that reason; raise it if a capture comes back on the
# splash screen.
#
#   tools/adam-shot.sh                     canned data, first screen
#   tools/adam-shot.sh "K_VIEW3"           scripted K_* keys, then capture
#   REAL=1 WAIT=45 tools/adam-shot.sh      against fujinet-pc-adam
#
# Needs adamem built with the FujiNet bridge (see the manual at
# fujinet-manuals/connecting-an-adam-emulator-to-fujinet-pc). REAL=1 expects
# fujinet-pc-adam to be listening; without it the client sits on "FujiNet not
# found", which is itself a useful thing to be able to capture.
