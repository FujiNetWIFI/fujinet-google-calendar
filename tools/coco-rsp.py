Drive xroar's GDB target far enough to photograph the screen.

Run the machine, wait until the PC lands inside the address range given -- in
practice plat_vsync(), the frame wait the program comes to rest in once its
scripted keys are spent -- and dump the 512 bytes of the 32x16 text page at
$0400 as hex on stdout. That is the entire
visual state of this program -- text, inverse video, semigraphics colour and
quadrant masks alike -- so a capture needs nothing else.

Four things about this target are worth knowing, and each cost an afternoon:

  - It halts the moment a connection is accepted (gdb.c's `gdb_machine_signal`
    on accept), so packets are accepted straight away with no interrupt first.
    But the listen backlog is one deep and accept() runs off the emulator
    thread, so a connect can succeed at the TCP level before anything is
    reading it: the first '?' has to be retried.

  - While the machine is running it answers every packet with '-' rather than
    queueing it. The only way to get its attention again is a raw 0x03.

  - 'Z0' breakpoints are accepted, answer OK, and never fire -- at least for
    RAM addresses on a coco2bus. Hence the poll below: interrupt, read the PC,
    and continue if it is not where we want it. It uses only the two primitives
    that do work, and lands on exactly the same instant a breakpoint would.

  - xroar's own -timeout counts *emulated* seconds. Paired with -no-ratelimit
    it fires before the machine finishes booting. tools/coco-shot.sh sets it
    absurdly high and relies on the socket timeout here instead.

Usage: coco-rsp.py <port> <lo-hex> <hi-hex> [timeout-seconds]
