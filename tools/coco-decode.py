"""
Render the CoCo's 32x16 page from the 512 bytes of it.

The 6847 decides per byte whether a cell is a character or a 2x2 block of
colour, so a decode has to say which, and for a semigraphics cell it has to say
both the colour and which quadrants are lit. That is not decoration: the chip
gutter, the WEEK chip strip and the MONTH density bars are the parts of this
client that only exist on this machine, and none of them is checkable from a
picture of text.

Three panes come out:

  text        the glyphs, with inverse video marked
  video       '#' where a cell is inverse -- the selection bar, the header
  colour      one letter per semigraphics cell, '.' for text

and then the quadrant detail, which is the screen drawn at 64x32 with each
semigraphics cell expanded into its four blocks. That last pane is where the
"31" punched out of the mark, and a density bar's exact step, are legible.

Reads the hex on stdin or from a file named on the command line.
