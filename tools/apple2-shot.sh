# Headless screen capture for the Apple II build.
#
# Builds the client, boots it in applen with no terminal of its own, takes a
# save state, and decodes the 80x24 text screen out of the two text pages in
# it. No X server, no window and no human required.
#
#   tools/apple2-shot.sh                          fake data, first screen
#   tools/apple2-shot.sh "K_DOWN,K_DOWN,K_ENTER"  fake data, scripted keys
#   REAL=1 WAIT=40 tools/apple2-shot.sh           real Google Calendar
#
# The key names are the K_* codes from src/gcal.h. Scripted keys are consumed
# first and then the program falls through to the real blocking read, which is
# exactly where the capture catches it with the screen of interest painted.
#
# applen comes from the FujiNet fork of AppleWin and is not built by default;
# see the Apple II notes in README.md. Point APPLEN at it, or let the search
# below find it.
#
# For a real run, start fujinet-pc first -- applen inserts the SmartPort relay
# in slot 5, which is how it reaches the adapter.
